Organizational Platform Design

This repo houses the academic and recreational designs of a massive solutions platform for commercial and non-commercial organizations with a particular emphasis on the public sector. Think schools, hospitals, prisons, and utilities.

Also, to be clear, this repo is not intended to the first step in the implementation of any of these solutions, but rather a collection of thorough thought exercises for the creator to understand and become familiar with common organizational problems at scale.
